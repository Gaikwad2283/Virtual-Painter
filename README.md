## AI Virtual Painter with Geometric Shapes | Drawing in Air | Computer Vision | OpenCV | AI TechStack

Welcome to the **AI Virtual Painter**, an innovative project developed in Python using OpenCV. This project allows users to draw in the air using computer vision technology. The following features are implemented:

### Features
1. **Variable Eraser Thickness**
2. **Drawing Circles**
3. **Drawing Rectangles**
4. **Drawing Ellipses**
5. **Free Hand Writing**
6. **Clear Screen with Two Fingers Up**
7. **Showing Brush Thickness on Screen**
8. **Increasing/Decreasing the Size of Shapes**

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Advanced_Virtual_Painter.git
    cd Advanced_Virtual_Painter
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install Required Packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the necessary packages individually:
    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python numpy
    ```

5. **Run the Application**:
    ```sh
    python virtual_painter.py
    ```

### Usage
- To draw, simply use your finger in front of the camera.
- Change shapes by using specific hand gestures.
- Adjust the brush thickness and shape size through on-screen controls.
- To clear the screen, raise two fingers.
